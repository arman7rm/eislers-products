                    <p>THE INSPIRATION:</p>
                    <p>
                        Customers loved my Forever Shine collection so much that I decided to create a lighter version
                        of it
                        with an enticing daytime scent profile: fruity-floral, green and unbelievably fresh. I’d
                        recently
                        been on a nature walk and came across some orange flowers in bloom. I used that exquisite
                        essence as
                        my jumping-off point, and added a mix of other essential oils, including bergamot and hints of
                        tangerine and vanilla. I spent months agonizing over each decision until I reached the perfect
                        combination. The safflower oleosomes and amino acids in the conditioner make all hair types look
                        bouncy and glossy, and the scent of the extracts is just as captivating. Even better, both the
                        conditioning agents and fragrance are time-released to keep you feeling gorgeous.
